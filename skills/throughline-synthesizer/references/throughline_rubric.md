THROUGH-LINE SELECTION RUBRIC
Prioritize through-lines that are:
- Cross-source consensus: multiple sources align on direction or risk
- Cross-source divergence: sources disagree on the same topic, signaling uncertainty or asymmetry
- Actionable: directly inform positioning, hedging, or trade construction
- Risk-identifying: surface threats to existing positions or consensus views
- Novel: non-consensus views supported by more than one source

Deprioritize:
- Single-source observations without corroboration or clear contrarian value
- Descriptive recaps of known events
- Vague or heavily hedged commentary without clear implications
- Themes that do not connect to rates, macro, or cross-market flows
