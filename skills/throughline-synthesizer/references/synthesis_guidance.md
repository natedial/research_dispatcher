SYNTHESIS GUIDANCE
For each through-line, synthesize what it reveals:
- Where sources agree and why
- Where sources disagree and implications
- Causal relationships and transmission mechanisms
- Actionable takeaways for positioning or monitoring

Keep insights concise and specific to rates, macro, or cross-market flows when relevant.
