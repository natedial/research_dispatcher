# Through-Line Synthesizer

Use this skill when the task is to synthesize multiple sources into a small set of actionable through-lines with clear attribution.

## Workflow
1. Scan inputs for recurring themes, divergences, and explicit trade or policy implications.
2. Select 3-8 through-lines using the rubric in `references/throughline_rubric.md`.
3. For each through-line, write a concise lead and a short synthesis that:
   - states where sources agree and why
   - states where sources disagree and what that implies
   - links to causal mechanisms or transmission paths
   - ends with a clear positioning or monitoring takeaway
4. Attribute every substantive claim to its supporting sources.
