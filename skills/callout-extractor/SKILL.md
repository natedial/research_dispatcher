# Callout Extractor

Use this skill when the task includes selecting quotable highlights from a synthesized analysis.

## Workflow
1. Read the synthesized insights and identify 2-4 segments that are high-signal.
2. Ensure each callout is punchy, specific, and standalone.
3. Attribute each callout to the sources that support it.
4. Do not invent facts; only use statements present in the synthesis.
