TASK
You are given TWO INPUTS aggregated from multiple research documents:
1. Extracted themes (tagged by source document)
2. Extracted trade ideas (tagged by source document)

Synthesize both inputs into a unified cross-document analysis. Identify 3-8 through-lines: meta-narratives that emerge across the research landscape.
